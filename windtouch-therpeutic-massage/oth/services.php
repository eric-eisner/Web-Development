					<td><font face="tahoma"><b>Relaxation Massage</b> - Incorporates Swedish and conventional massage techniques to increase circulation, decrease stress, and relax the total body.  Essential oils are used to bring healthy nutrients to the skin and underlying tissues.  At your option, soft, meditative music can be played to help you relax and facilitate stress relief.</td>

					<td><font face="tahoma"><b>Craniosacral Therapy</b> - Is a light touch manual therapy that addresses restrictions in the Craniosacral system - the membranes and fluid that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord.  This vital system extends from the bones of the skull, face and mouth, which make up the cranium, down to the sacrum, or tailbone. Since the Craniosacral system directly impacts the central nervous system, it's easy to see how an imbalance there could cause any number of sensory, motor or neurological disabilities.  Craniosacral Therapy helps correct those restrictions so the body can release the effects of stress - naturally. Research strongly suggests that the birth process is responsible for many brain dysfunctions and central nervous system problems.  Craniosacral Therapy carried out in the delivery room or within the first few days of life could potentially reduce a wide variety of difficulties, many of which might not become apparent until your child is in school.  Even problems with head shape and skull-bone override can be corrected with the use of Craniosacral Therapy. Clients have found this therapy useful for migraines and headaches, after trauma both physical and emotional, during pregnancy, fatigue, depression, anxiety and when they just can't seem to relax.  Stroke patients who start receiving this treatment within six weeks after the stroke seem to enhance the recovery process.  This therapy is useful to athletes who are not achieving the performance they want by helping their bodies recover through a deeper relaxation than can be achieved with massage.</td>

					<td><font face="tahoma"><b>Neuromuscular Therapy</b> - Helps restore the structural, functional and postural integrity of the body.  Neuromuscular therapy removes restrictions, normalizes dysfunction, reduces pain, energy loss, improves posture and biomechanics.  Cassandra accomplishes these tasks by evaluating and addressing the body's soft-tissue components.  She responds to specific conditions such as ischemia(the lack of blood flow due to hyper constricted tissues), nerve compression or entrapment, neurological trigger point sensation and postural distortion using several treatment modalities.</td>

Pure essential oils are used for this treatment.  This therapy is deeply relaxing and powerfully effective in flushing waste from the body and stimulating its natural immune strength.  Cassandra recommends this treatment during each change of season to boost your body's immune system and reduce your susceptibility to illness.</td>
